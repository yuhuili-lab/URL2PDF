URL2PFD and Download URLS as PDFs [Version 6.3]
===============================================

URL2PDF is a commandline utility that downloads URLs as PDFs. Included is an action for Apple's Automator called Download URLS as PDFs, which allows the user to archive a web page as a PDF document in a given workflow.

#Release Notes

I finally gave up on trying to update the original action to work in Lion and decided to take a completely different approach. All of the heavy lifting is now handled by a commandline utility called URL2PDF, which is wrapped by an AppleScript-based Automator Action.
